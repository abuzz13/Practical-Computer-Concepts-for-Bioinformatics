Linux Lab 1  
Drills – just do them, nothing to turn in for these first three: 
1. Using PuTTY on PCs, or ssh -l [your username] from a Mac's (OS X) Terminal window, connect to bfx3.aap.jhu.edu ; login with your username and password (same as you use to access JHU email and Blackboard). 
2. Do the exercises in Learning the UNIX Operating System on page 13 (end of the 'Syntax of UNIX Command Lines' section). 
3. When done, type exit to logout.  
Exercises - turn in at beginning of next week's class: 
Type cd ~jgreene2 and list all the files in this directory. Do any begin with a . ? What command did you use? 
		Use the command ls to list all files not hidden and it looks like there are no files beginning with a “.”
Now list all files, including hidden ones. How many hidden files are there?  What command did you use? (Compare with above results; . and .. do not count) 
		To find hidden files I used the command ls -a -l or you can also use ls -al, there are 162 hidden files. When you search ls -l it indicates the total (17064) and ls -al also indicates a total (17226). 
List all information about the files, in the long format. When was testy.pl last modified? What command did you use?
		To list all information about files in the long format, I used the controls ls -l. testy.pl was last modified Feb. 19th, 2020.
